### Project Update Guide

Keeping your project up to date is crucial. Please refer to the [Project Update Guide section](docs/Installation.md#project-update-guide) for guidelines on how to update your project to the latest version.

## Project Structure

Understanding the project's architecture is key to working with the code. Please refer to the [Project Structure section](docs/ProjectStructure.md) for an overview of the directory layout and file organization.

## Framework Setup

Learn how to configure and customize the framework to suit your needs. Please refer to the [Framework Setup section](docs/FrameworkSetup.md) for detailed instructions.

### Page set up and Switching Pages

Managing page navigation is a common task in web testing. Please refer to the [Pages section](docs/FrameworkSetup.md#switching-pages) for techniques and examples on how to set up a page and switch between different pages within your tests.

## Usage

### Page Objects

Page objects are utilized to encapsulate information about the elements present on each page of your application. They also provide a structured way to write action and assertion functions for various functionalities on each page. This approach promotes code reusability and makes the tests easier to maintain and understand. Page objects can be found in the `pages` directory.

Here's an example of a page object under the `pages` package:

**sauce-demo-login-page.ts**

```typescript
//importing utility functions
import { click, clickAndNavigate, fill, gotoURL } from '@ActionUtils';
import { failureLoginCredentials, successLoginCredentials } from '../../testdata/sauce-demo-test-data';
import { expectElementToBeVisible } from '@AssertUtils';
import { getLocator, getLocatorByPlaceholder, getLocatorByRole } from '@LocatorUtils';

const userName = `#user-name`;
const password = () => getLocator(`#password`).or(getLocatorByPlaceholder('Password', { exact: true }));
const login = () => getLocatorByRole('button', { name: 'Login' });
const errorMessage = `//*[contains(@class,'error-message')]`;

export async function navigateToSauceDemoLoginPage() {
  await gotoURL('https://www.saucedemo.com/');
}

export async function logInSuccessfully() {
  await fill(userName, successLoginCredentials.username);
  await fill(password(), successLoginCredentials.password);
  await clickAndNavigate(login());
}

export async function failureLogin() {
  await fill(userName, failureLoginCredentials.username);
  await fill(password(), failureLoginCredentials.password);
  await click(login());
}

export async function verifyErrorMessageForFailureLogin() {
  await expectElementToBeVisible(errorMessage);
}

export async function verifyLoginPageisDisplayed() {
  await expectElementToBeVisible(userName);
}
```

In this example, the `sauce-demo-login-page` represents the login page within the application. It includes methods to navigate to the Saucedemo homepage, execute both successful and unsuccessful login actions, verify the success of the login in the successful login scenario, and confirm the display of an error message in the case of a failed login.

Refer to the [Utilities](docs/Utilities.md) section on how to use the reusable methods.

Refer to the [Running Tests](#executing-tests) section below on how to run tests.

### Writing Tests in a spec file

Tests are written in the `specs` directory. Each test file should correspond to a specific feature or functionality of the application under test. Tests are constructed using Page objects.

Here's an example of a test file under the `specs` directory:

**sauce-demo-preferred-pom.spec.ts**

```typescript
//import test from PageSetup.ts which sets up the page before each test
import { test } from '@PageSetup';

//importing page objects to use all functions within that page to construct the tests
import * as LoginPage from 'tests/pages/preferredPOM/sauce-demo-login-page';
import * as MiniCart from 'tests/pages/preferredPOM/sauce-demo-mini-cart';
import * as ProductsPage from 'tests/pages/preferredPOM/sauce-demo-products-page';

test.describe('Saucedemo tests for successful, unsuccessful logins and add product to cart', () => {
  test('Saucedemo tests - Successful login will display Products Page', async () => {
    await LoginPage.navigateToSauceDemoLoginPage();
    await LoginPage.logInSuccessfully();
    //verifying products page is displayed on successful login
    await ProductsPage.verifyProductsPageDisplayed();
  });

  test('Saucedemo test - Add product to cart', async () => {
    await LoginPage.navigateToSauceDemoLoginPage();
    await LoginPage.logInSuccessfully();
    await ProductsPage.verifyProductsPageDisplayed();
    await ProductsPage.addToCartByProductNumber(1);
    //verifying mini cart count is updated to 1
    await MiniCart.verifyMiniCartCount('1');
  });

  test('Saucedemo test - When login is unsuccessful will not display Products Page', async () => {
    await LoginPage.navigateToSauceDemoLoginPage();
    await LoginPage.failureLogin();
    await LoginPage.verifyErrorMessageForFailureLogin();
    //verifying Login is still displayed
    await LoginPage.verifyLoginPageisDisplayed();
    //verifying Products Page is not displayed
    await ProductsPage.verifyProductsPageNotDisplayed();
  });
});
```

In this example, we are setting the page state by importing `test` from `@PageSetup` and writing the spec file. Here are some important points to note:

1. Import `test` from `@PageSetup` instead from `@playwright/test`. `page-setup` is customized for this framework to set the page state. This ensures that the page is set up correctly before each test.

2. `setPage` function from `page-setup` file will set the page state before each test and is imported to our spec files while executing the tests. If you want to use the Playwright page directly to write our tests, we can use `getPage` function from `page-utils` file. The page object is managed by the framework, and we can use the `setPage` and `getPage` functions to set and get the page state, ensuring that all of the pages operate on the same page object.

3. We first navigate to the home page, then perform the login action, and finally verify if the login was successful.

In this example, the `LoginPage` represents a login page within the application. It includes methods to navigate to the homepage, perform a login action, and check if the login was successful. Similarly, `ProductsPage` and `MiniCart` are also page objects that have functions for their respective pages.

## Utilities

Explore various utility functions and helpers that can make your testing more efficient. The Utilities section in this project encompasses a variety of functions designed to enhance the efficiency of your testing process. These utilities include:

1. [Page Utilities](docs/Utilities.md#page-utilities): Functions that assist in setting and getting the page object.
2. [Locator Utilities](docs/Utilities.md#locator-utilities): Functions that assist in locating elements on the page, making it easier to interact with them.
3. [Action Utilities](docs/Utilities.md#action-utilities): Functions that encapsulate common actions like clicking, typing, or dragging, providing a more concise way to express these operations in your tests.
4. [Element Utilities](docs/Utilities.md#element-utilities): Functions for handling conditional statements with web elements, such as checking if an element is visible, hidden, or contains certain text or input values.
5. [Assertion Utilities](docs/Utilities.md#assert-utilities): Helpers that simplify the process of making assertions about the state of the application, enhancing the readability and maintainability of your tests.
6. [Optional Parameter Type Objects](docs/Utilities.md#optional-parameter-type-objects): Provides a set of options for utility modules.

Please refer to the [Utilities section](docs/Utilities.md) for a comprehensive guide to the available utilities in this project, including detailed descriptions and examples of how to use them.

## Executing Tests

We have the flexibility to execute a single test, a specific set of tests, or the entire test suite. Testing can be carried out on a single browser or across multiple browsers simultaneously. By default, tests run in a headless mode, and the test outcomes are displayed in the terminal.

### Run tests using plugin

**`Playwright Test for VSCode`** plugin empowers you to run specific tests or entire test suites directly from the editor. You can conveniently trigger tests with a click, making it efficient to validate changes.

For detailed guidance on plugin installation, configuring test settings in the playwright.config file, and executing tests, please visit [Executing tests using a Playwright plugin](docs/ExecutingTests.md#run-tests-using-the-playwright-plugin).

### Parallel Execution

Playwright allows you to execute tests in parallel across multiple workers. This can significantly speed up your test suite.

To enable parallel execution, add the following line at the top of your spec file, above the `test` block:

```typescript
test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' });
```

The number of workers can be configured either in the `playwright.config` file or via the command-line interface.

### Running Tests via the Command-Line Interface

Utilize a variety of commands to execute your tests in different modes. Below are a few illustrative examples:

#### npm run commands

The `package.json` file contains several scripts designed to streamline test execution. Here are a few common examples:

- To run a single test in chromium headed mode (i.e., with the browser UI visible), use the `grep` command to specify the test:

```bash
npm run test:chromium-headed -- -g 'login test'
```

- To run all the tests in a spec file in chromium headless mode:

```bash
npm run test:chromium -- nucleus.spec.ts
```

- To run all the tests in multiple spec files in headed mode:

```bash
npm run test:chromium-headed -- checkout.spec.ts nucleus.spec.ts
```

- To run all the tests in a spec file with 3 threads, and 2 retries in chromium headless mode:

```bash
npm run test:chromium -- nucleus.spec.ts -j 3 --retries 2
```

- To run in debug mode:

```bash
npm run test:chromium-headed -- nucleus.spec.ts --debug
```

- To run all the smoke tests using the tag in headless mode for all the projects:

```bash
npm run test -- -g '@smoke'
```

- To run all tests in headless mode for all the projects:

```bash
npm run test
```

#### npx playwright test commands

You can use the following playwright commands as well to run your tests:

```bash
npx playwright test -c playwright.config.ts -g "logo is present @reg" --headed -j 1 --retries 0
```

Here's what each option does:

- `-c`: Specifies the configuration file for Playwright. In this case, it's `playwright.config.ts`.
- `-g`: This is the "grep" option, which allows you to run specific tests instead of all of them. In this case, it's running the test with the name "logo is present @reg".
- `-j`: Specifies the number of workers to use. In this case, it's `1`.
- `--retries`: Specifies the number of times to retry failed tests. In this case, it's `0`.
- `--headed`: Runs the tests in headed mode. By default, tests are run in headless mode.
- `--project=chromium`: Runs the tests in the Playwright Chromium browser. By default, it will run all the projects in the playwright.config.ts
- `--repeat-each 3`: Repeats each test 3 times. This is useful for verifying the stability of a test or checking intermittent issue fixes locally by running the test multiple times.
- `--grep-invert`: The opposite of `-g` or grep. It filters out the tests to run.
- `--max-failures 4`: Stops after the first 4 test failures. This includes a count of failures in the retry test as well.
- `--list`: Lists all the tests, but does not run them.

[![CLI Parallel Execution](http://img.youtube.com/vi/gtkoLizAsaw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtkoLizAsaw 'CLI Parallel Execution')

For more information, please refer to the [Playwright CLI documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli).

## Report Generation and Viewing

Playwright Test offers several built-in reporters tailored for various requirements, along with the flexibility to integrate custom reporters. You can configure these reporters either through the command line or within the `playwright.config.ts` file. For a comprehensive guide on Playwright's in-built reporters, refer to the official [documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters).

### Accessing Reports via Command-Line Interface (CLI)

- **Playwright command**: After executing tests, you can view the reports using the following command:

```bash
npx playwright show-report <path to the report>
```

- **Framework Configured script**: This framework's configuration for viewing reports is defined in the `package.json` under the `scripts` section:

```json
"report": "playwright show-report playwright-report"
```

To access the reports post-test execution using this configuration, run:

```bash
npm run report
```

## Additional Playwright Features

- **UI Mode**: Playwright's UI mode allows you to explore, run, and debug tests in a watch mode. Dive deeper into this feature [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode).

- **Test Generator**: With Playwright, you can automatically generate tests. It inspects the page to determine the optimal locator, prioritizing by role, text, and test ID locators. Learn more about test generation using Codegen [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen).

- **Trace Viewer**: The Playwright Trace Viewer offers a graphical interface to review recorded traces post-execution. Get more details [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer).

## Best Practices

Here are some recommended best practices when using this framework:

- **Use Utility Functions**: Whenever possible, use the [Utilities](docs/Utilities.md) functions provided in the framework instead of directly using Playwright methods. These utility functions are designed to simplify common tasks and make your tests more readable and maintainable.

- **Feedback on Utility Functions**: If you find that a utility function for a specific action or assertion is missing, please provide feedback so we can continue to improve and expand our utility Functions. Meanwhile, temporarily use the corresponding Playwright method combined with `getPage` from `@PageSetup` for a specific task, the utility function is not available. Replace these with newly added utility functions once they are available.

- **Conditional Statements**: Instead of manually implementing waits, use functions like `isElementVisible`, `isElementChecked` from [elementutils](docs/Utilities.md#elementutils). These functions automatically wait for the element to become visible, with customizable timeout options. It's advisable to avoid using these for assertions; instead, utilize [AssertUtils](docs/Utilities.md#assertutils) wherever possible.

- **Retrieving Text and Input Values**: To fetch texts or input values, consider functions like `getAllTexts` and `getAllInputValues` from [elementutils](docs/Utilities.md#elementutils). These methods come with built-in waits, ensuring they only proceed once an element is available, preventing premature returns of an empty Array<string>.

- **clickandNavigate vs click**: If a click action triggers page navigation, use the `clickandNavigate` utility function instead of the `click` function. `clickandNavigate` function includes built-in checks for frame navigation and waits for a new page to load. Use the `click` function if it is an Ajax call when you don't navigate to a different page.

- **Fill vs Type**: Use the fill utility function as default to fill form fields. Use type when you want to simulate typing character by character, such as when testing auto-search suggestions or autofill features. [Playwright type documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/input#type-characters)

- **Web-First Assertions**: Prioritize using playwright web-first assertions in your tests instead of jest or other library assertions. [Playwright Web First Assertions documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices#use-web-first-assertions)

- **Soft Assertions for Non-Critical Checks**: Use a soft assertion when a test assertion isn't critical, allowing the test to continue and fail at the end. For critical assertions, use a hard assertion i.e. the default assertion. [Playwright Soft Assertions documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#soft-assertions)

- **Backticks for Xpath & CSS**: Always use backticks for Xpath & CSS selectors so that you can use single & double quotes together if needed without any escape characters.

- **Playwright's Inbuilt Features**: Playwright comes with a wide range of inbuilt features. Make sure to utilize these as needed.
